HOW TO LAUNCH SHEET_INVEST PROTOTYPE

Go into either version of the game 
(sheet_invest V1.0, sheet_invest_Lite)>interface and either direct execute the launcher or open ur IDE and use F5 or whatever you launch script with your IDE.

PERSONAL NOTE: 
I use SciTe windows edition as my IDE and I came into problem while opening the files with NotePad++.(indentation) It may (most certainly) was my fault, but VSCODE might be the best bet.
